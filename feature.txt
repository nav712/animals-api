Observe is not an internal Barclays product but an external one.

Barclays’ internal documentation is available at:

Their public website is: https://www.observeinc.com/

Documentation: https://docs.observeinc.com/en/latest/content/common-topics/WelcometoObserve.html

I have reviewed the available documentation in detail and cannot find any reference indicating direct support for MXG, z/OS, or SMF. Based on this, the only possible approaches would be:

Pre-process SMF/MXG data through an ETL pipeline that transforms it into a format Observe accepts. This includes labeling/annotating all fields into schemas that Observe can interpret. This is by far the largest effort.

Ingest the transformed data into Observe as custom logs or metrics.

Create reports on top of the ingested, transformed dataset.

Given this, I am not fully convinced that Observe would provide any meaningful advantage over tools such as SMT Data or EPV, which are already designed to work directly with SMF/MXG data. Observe would require significant custom work and a full PoC before we could even validate viability.
